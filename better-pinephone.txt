My take on Pinephone. Doesn't need to be slim, 
If it can do blender, video and image editing without fuss (for more basic scenes), 
is already the super phone in my eyes
GPU is somewhere near but still far from GeForce 920m / whatever Poco F1 has? 
(can run gta vice city - re3 native port without fuss)
Capable of VM maybe?
Ideally speaker is on bottom (like Poco F1), dual sim, 
uses nano sim 
(
if still micro then why not swap with sdcard, 
like sd card on bottom and sim on top bc better grip
sdcard is one single part and being at bottom plus already has sharp turn
it being at the top doesn't make sense
)

I'd personally like to see keyboard case + fingerprint + NFC/RFID reader-writer all in one package... 
Then again as phrase goes "too many features all in one go creates a monster"
Still would be cool to have ig.
I wonder what else you could achieve with pogo pins...




also more phones should have boot from sdcard / usb.
system update broke something? swipe down sdcard  you already have with backup install
and you still can live. decrypt files on internal storage, use jumpdrive to make a backup

twrp feels more risque. other phones may need EDL mode, for which access to may be exclusive to
particular authorized repair centers, just to unbrick device. 
On top of that usually needs bootloader unlocking.
