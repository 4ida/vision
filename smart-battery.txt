Ig It be nice if power banks revealed battery status, health etc by pluggin in to PC.
Probably would allow to be used like UPS
(can charge and use at same time, when 100% charged most power goes to device), 
easier for DIY Laptop, can integrate with system etc, it's cheaper and universal


even if not powerbanks, a simple board to connect some battery
which provides two cables (charging and data) probably would be less costly
than whatever pijuice is offering

while on topic, how's idea of multi-source power?
pi would know which power it's using
id1 id2 id3 etc, up to programmer (script on pi user can edit, decide on automated tasks) 
to change source on demand and what to do with it

e.g. power from grid went out, autoswitch to battery.
battery status / health bad, use backup battery or even other connection to grid/power outlet.
