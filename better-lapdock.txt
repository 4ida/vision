Ideally lapdock should have a slot for modules.
something like "Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+", "SOPINE A64" and others 
ususally used in clusterboards.

As well as hopefully maybe one day you'll be able to use lapdock wirelessly. 
Even by today limitation of Wifi Miracast (video) + Bluetooth (keyboard, touchpad)
can kinda do the trick at cost of needing to use mobile data, no usb ports and touchscreen.

Maybe a tiny VNC application could be baked into lapdock firmware, but may increase costs 
(needs wifi or ethernet port)


For my needs, i'd just need atleast one USB port (type a or type-c with data to use adapters)
Having microsd, ethernet would be nice. 
Touchscreen may seem not to be used or needed much but is helpful (especially for waydroid use case)
(plus touchpad or mouse movements back and forth can be repetitive for batch tasks)
